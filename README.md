# Image processing script for plasma Electron density reconstruction from plasma interferograms
- INPUT: Reference interferogram and Plasma interferogram
- OUTPUT: Electron density map
The script uses the diffraction peak filtration technique to retrieve the phase image, symmetrizes the image, then uses one of PyAbel's Abel inversion algorithms to retrieve the change in index of refraction map of the plasma, then, from Drude's model equation, calculates the electron density map.

## Structure
The Jupyter notebook 'Phase_shift_extraction_automated.ipynb' lets the user view the data processing of a single Plasma measurement. The script 'main_automized_el_density.py' automated the process on a set of Plasma measurements.

## Installation
When installing the *PyAbel* package, if an error occurs, one must replace the nested function with:
```python
return input.decode("utf-8", errors='ignore')
```

Then return the function to its previous state.
- Code has been tested on Windows 10, IDE PyCharm
